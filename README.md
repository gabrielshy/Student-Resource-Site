## Inspiration
Before going into the project, we thought about how we can improve the lives of students like us. We settled on the idea of creating a website that hosts helpful student resources that we ourselves use.

## What it does
Our website has multiple functions. The most prominent function is the resources tab, where we keep multiple helpful student resources. Our textbook section allows people to search ISBNs and are currently able to get Amazon Prices for it. For aesthetic and accessibility, we’ve added a dark-mode option to the website as well.

## How we built it
To build our website, we used HTML/CSS and JavaScript, an Amazon API to pull data from, and used Google Firebase to deploy our website.

## Challenges we ran into
Going into the project, we both had different coding backgrounds and were both beginners at JavaScript. To prepare, we both learned extensively about it, and how we can use it to build our design. Another problem we faced was the APIs. One of our APIs, AbeBooks, was difficult to use and was an extreme headache.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re both proud of the amount we’ve learned and what we’ve built, and being able to deploy our first-ever website was a great feeling.

## What we learned
We’ve learned a whole lot: JavaScript, APIs, and Web Development - it might have been a pain, but we’re happy.

## What's next for StudentPluh
StudentPluh won’t be going away for a long time. We plan on implementing more APIs for the textbook search function and have more ideas coming - one of which is a resume helper. We also plan to update the resource page constantly, putting whatever we find helpful on it. Lastly, we hope to branch our website out further to other students to get feedback and build a community.
